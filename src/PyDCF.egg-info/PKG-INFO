# Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi Method (Python)
Star formation is one of nature's many mysteries that has no clear explanation among astrophysicists and astronomers. Two fundamental forces of nature- Electromagnetism and Gravity, are believed to play a pivotal role during this process but appear to be in opposition to each other based on our current scientific theories.

The Davis Chandrasekhar Fermi method is an proposed theory that relates the polarization of light to the large scale magnetic field strength of the interstellar medium. Through this method, we can analyze polarization maps in order to have a stronger understanding of the role that Magnetic fields play in the Star Formation Process.

Since it's initial proposition, the method has gone through several modificiations.

This method is based off the paper written by Houde et al. (2009)- https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5227.pdf.
